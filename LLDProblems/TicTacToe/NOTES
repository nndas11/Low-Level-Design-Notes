    -   PLAYER -> BOARD -> 2 TYPES OF PLAYING PIECES
    -   GAME -> TOP CLASS -> SHOULD WE NEED?


    - PLAYERS INTERACT WITH GAME AND PLACE PLAYING PIECES ON BOARD


- Method to check game won or not -> should go in the BOARD class ->
- because the board holds the data needed to evaluate it, and it's a board-level concern.
-



- The main part of the problem -> the algorithm to check if a person have won the game or not -> this is only there to check in the question.
- We can do O(n) solution but even that should be better to O(1)

- The best way would be
- Use array to keep track of each row
- Array for each col
- Diagonal and Anti-diagonal count

- so for +1 and -1 value -> if no issue of extensibilty and there shouldn't be as the game always had only two symbols.
- we have to keep all this variables in the board class -> as the placing method is here.

- If we want to extend to more players, then instead of array
- Use HashMap of player id ->  score
- Each player is assigned 1 symbol only, so keeping track of played id to count is equivalent to symbol to count.
