    -   Elevator Car
    -   Building
    -   Floor
    -   UP, DOWN, -> ENUM



    - So in Low-level design is all about designing the component and their interaction etc..
    - A person coming and clicking a button for elevator is an external factor -> we don't need that in design.
    - In most cases, this is true.
    - But there will be cases like game like tic-tac-toe, where you need person -> then only we can determine the winner.
